0.2.0

The version changes the order of the when a view has render called on it when
it is being swapped by a SwappingRouter. This fixes some browsers which would
display a flash of unstyled content when performing certain actions in their
render, like changing the body class. It introduces the requirement that all
views return an instance of themselves when rendered (a fairly standard
backbone convention).
